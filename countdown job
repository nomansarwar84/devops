The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to create few jobs in Kubernetes cluster. They might come up with some real scripts/commands to use, but for now they are preparing the templates and testing the jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:


Create a job countdown-xfusion.

The spec template should be named as countdown-xfusion (under metadata), and the container should be named as container-countdown-xfusion

Use image fedora with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e fedora:latest, and restart policy should be Never.

Use command sleep 5

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Solution

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-xfusion
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-xfusion
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: container-countdown-xfusion
          image: fedora:latest
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
          args:
            [
              "sleep 5"
            ]

      restartPolicy: Never
